## Important Disclaimers

### This System is a SIGNAL GENERATOR

✅ **What it does:** Analyzes market and suggests trades
❌ **What it doesn't do:** Execute trades for you

### No Money Moves Without Your Action

- System NEVER touches your trading account
- System NEVER places orders
- System NEVER collects/pays money
- **YOU** decide whether to execute signals
- **YOU** place all orders manually
- **YOU** manage your actual positions

### Tracking is for Monitoring Only

When the system says:
- "Position Entered" = We generated a signal
- "Premium ₹158" = Theoretical premium for the recommendation
- "Layer 1 added" = We recommended a trade

It **does NOT** mean:
- ❌ We executed a trade
- ❌ You received money
- ❌ You have an actual position (unless YOU placed it)

## FAQ

**Q: If I receive a SELL signal, do I have a position?**
A: No. You only have a position if YOU manually placed the order on your broker.

**Q: What does "Premium ₹158" mean?**
A: It's the credit you would receive IF you sell that straddle. It's not money you've received.

**Q: Does the system know if I executed the trade?**
A: No. The system doesn't connect to your broker. It tracks signals, not actual trades.

**Q: Should I execute every signal?**
A: No. Signals are recommendations. Review each one and decide based on your risk tolerance.

**Q: What if I miss a signal?**
A: No problem. Signals are time-sensitive. If you miss one, wait for the next.

**Q: Can I paper trade (test without real money)?**
A: Yes! Just track signals and see how they would have performed without executing real trades.
