Winning Trades:  6  (35.29%) ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░
Losing Trades:  11  (64.71%) █████████████░░░░░░░░
```

### Why Strategy is Still Profitable

**Break-even win rate calculation:**
```
Break-even = 1 / (1 + R:R)
           = 1 / (1 + 5.25)
           = 16%
```

**Current win rate: 35.29% (MORE THAN DOUBLE the break-even!)**

This means even with only 35% winners, the strategy is highly profitable because winners are so much larger than losers.

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority (Implement These)

#### 1. Add Volume Confirmation ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Current Issue:**
- 65% false breakouts
- No volume filter at entry

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
# In config.py or strategy code
ATR_VOLUME_MULTIPLIER = 1.5  # Volume must be 1.5× average

# At entry:
if current_volume > avg_volume * 1.5:
    # Take trade
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Win rate: 35% → 45-50%
- Fewer false breakouts
- Better trade quality

#### 2. Increase ATR Entry Multiplier ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current Value:** 2.5
**Recommended:** 3.0

**Rationale:**
- Higher threshold = fewer but higher quality breakouts
- Reduce false signals
- May lower trade count but improve win rate

**Update in `.env`:**
```bash
ATR_ENTRY_MULTIPLIER=3.0  # Up from 2.5
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Trade count: 17 → 12-15
- Win rate: 35% → 40-45%
- R:R ratio: Maintained or improved

#### 3. Test Tighter Stop Loss

**Current Value:** 0.5 × ATR
**Recommended Test:** 0.4 × ATR

**Rationale:**
- Stop loss already working well (-1.21% avg)
- Could tighten slightly for better R:R
- Risk: More stop outs

**Update in `.env`:**
```bash
ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER=0.4  # Down from 0.5 (TEST FIRST)
```

**Action:** Backtest with 0.4 before implementing live

### Medium Priority (Consider Testing)

#### 4. Add Price Filter

**Concept:** Only trade above certain moving average

**Implementation:**
```python
# Only enter if price > 20-day MA
if current_price > sma_20:
    # Confirms uptrend
    # Take trade
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Better trend alignment
- Fewer counter-trend trades
- Possible win rate improvement

#### 5. Position Sizing Based on ATR

**Concept:** Adjust position size based on volatility

**Implementation:**
```python
# Risk 1% of capital per trade
position_size = (capital * 0.01) / stop_loss_distance
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Consistent risk per trade
- Better capital management
- Smoother equity curve

### Low Priority (Optional Enhancements)

#### 6. Add Time-Based Exit

**Concept:** Exit after 3-5 days if no target hit

**Rationale:**
- Average holding: 2.8 days
- Some trades may linger
- Free up capital faster

#### 7. Test Different ATR Periods

**Current:** ATR(20) and ATR(30)
**Test:** ATR(14) and ATR(28)

**Impact:** Unknown - requires backtesting
