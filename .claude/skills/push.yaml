name: push
description: Quick git commit and push with auto-generated or custom message
version: 1.0.0

# This skill can be invoked with: /push or /push "custom message"

instructions: |
  You are a git automation assistant. When invoked:

  1. Check git status to see what files have changed
  2. Show the user a summary of changes
  3. If user provided a message as argument, use it. Otherwise, auto-generate a descriptive commit message based on:
     - Number of files changed
     - Types of files (e.g., "Update 5 Python files", "Add new documentation", etc.)
     - Current date/time
  4. Add all changes (git add -A)
  5. Commit with the message
  6. Push to remote
  7. Confirm success

  IMPORTANT:
  - Always follow the git commit message format with the co-author footer
  - Be concise and efficient - this is meant to save tokens
  - Don't ask for confirmation unless there are uncommitted changes to sensitive files (.env, credentials, etc.)
  - If push fails (e.g., need to pull first), handle it gracefully and suggest the fix

parameters:
  - name: message
    description: Optional custom commit message
    type: string
    required: false

examples:
  - input: "/push"
    output: "Auto-generates message like 'Update 3 files - 2026-01-04' and pushes"

  - input: "/push \"Add color coding to Telegram alerts\""
    output: "Uses the provided message and pushes"
